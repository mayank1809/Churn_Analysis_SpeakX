# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Report
# Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning for a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers terminate their relationship with a company, which can lead to revenue loss and decreased profitability. By predicting churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about telecom customers, including demographic data, services subscribed, and churn status.

# Approach
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed to understand customer behavior and factors influencing churn. Various visualizations such as histograms, count plots, and correlation matrices were used to explore the data.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features were created to aid in predicting churn. A new feature called 'SeniorCitizen_Partner' was derived from existing features.

Model Building: Logistic regression and random forest classifiers were trained on the dataset to predict churn. The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User Interface: A Streamlit-based user interface was developed to allow users to interact with the churn prediction models by entering customer details.

Model Consensus: A mechanism was implemented to resolve discrepancies between the predictions of logistic regression and random forest models, ensuring robust predictions.

Distribution of churn: The dataset contains a relatively balanced distribution of churned and non-churned customers.

Numerical features vs. churn: Tenure, monthly charges, and total charges show varying distributions between churned and non-churned customers.

Payment method distribution: Churn varies across different payment methods, with electronic check having the highest churn rate.

# Model Evaluation:
Logistic regression achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of X%, recall of X%, and F1-score of X%.
Random forest achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of X%, recall of X%, and F1-score of X%.
Confusion matrices were used to visualize the performance of each model.
Check Churn Feature:
Users can input customer details through the user interface to predict churn using the trained models.
# Conclusion
The developed churn prediction system provides valuable insights into customer behavior and enables the company to proactively identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and interactive user interfaces, the company can improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall business performance.

# Challenges
Imbalanced Data: Addressing imbalanced data distribution in the dataset required careful consideration during model training and evaluation.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for predicting churn and engineering new features posed challenges in understanding the underlying factors influencing customer churn.
#Future Work
Model Optimization: Explore techniques for further improving the performance of churn prediction models, such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods.
Customer Segmentation: Conduct more granular analysis by segmenting customers based on demographics, usage patterns, and other factors to personalize retention strategies.
Real-time Monitoring: Implement a system for real-time monitoring of customer churn using streaming data processing techniques.
